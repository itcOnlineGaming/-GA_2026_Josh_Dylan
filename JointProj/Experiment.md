Condition B(lower countdown timer) had a higher survival time overall 
compared to Condition A( higher countdowntime),
it supports josh hypothesis of it almost if not fully being 2x survival rate 
with the lower countdown timer.

----Design Decision----
We chose Condition A because the data showed a lower survival time , 
hence a higher difficulty to the game.
